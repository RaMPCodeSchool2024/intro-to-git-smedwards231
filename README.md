# git-intro
An introduction to version control with git.

Instructions:
1. Edit the mystery_script.sh so that it prints "My name is __", with your name ;), after "Hello World". 
2. Edit the mystery_script.sh so that it asks the user for an input integer and prints out every even integer from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).
3. Run the script to confirm it does what you expect.
4. Add your changes, commit them, then push to the GitHub Classroom repository.
